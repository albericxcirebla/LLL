# Lower Level Library

Series of Templates for developing Crypto, Database, or Protocol. Base templates for the TAO framework, which will inhereit these templates and create higher level functionality such as Tritium, Amine, and Obsidian for Nexus. This framework is the foundation to Nexus and a 3DC. 


### Lower Level Crypto

Set of Operations for handling Crypto including:

* Digital Signatures (ECDSA, Schnorr, Hash Based)
* Hashing (SHA3 / Notable Secure Algorithms)
* Encryption (Symmetric / Assymmetric)
* Post-Quantum Cyrptography (Experimental)


### Lower Level Database

Set of Templates for designing high efficiency database systems. Core templates can be expanded into higher level database types.

* Key Database
* Sector Database
* Transaction Database (ACID)
* Checkpoint Database (Journal)

### Lower Level Protocol

Set of Client / Server templates for efficient data handling. Processes over 10k connections per server. Inherit and create custom packet types to write a new protocol with ease and no network programming required.

* Data Server
* Listening Server
* Connection Types
* Packet Styles
* Event Triggers
* DDOS Throttling


### Utilities

Set of useful tools for developing any program such as:

* Serialization
* Runtime
* Debug
* Arguments
* Containers
* Configuration
* Sorting
* Allocators

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute as always submit a pull request. This library development is expected to be on-going, with new higher level templates created for any types of use in the web.


## Applications
This is a foundational piece of Nexus that can be rebased over a Nexus branch to incorporate new LLL features into Nexus. It could also be useful for:

* Custom MySQL Servers
* Custom WebServers
* Custom Protocols
* Scalable Databases

These core templates can be expanded in any way by inheriting the base templates and creating any type of new backend that one would like.


## Why?
Because a lot of software that we use today for databases, or protocols, or cyrptography was created back in the 1990's as open source software. Since then the industry has expanded and bloated this code causing performance degragation. The aim of these templates is performance in simplicity. Include only what is needed, no more, and no less. This allows extremely high performance and scaleability necessary for the new distributed systems that will continue to evolve over the next few decades.
